</ol></div><div id="c55" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n2"><h1>What to contribute</h1></div><p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG
 is entirely free software and free artwork. It is developed exclusively
 by volunteers in their leisure time. FreedroidRPG depends on these 
contributions to become a better game. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are many things you can help with, being a 
programmer or not does not matter! (A game is not developed entirely by 
programmers.)
</p>
<h2>Testing and bug reporting</h2>
<p class="bodytext">We need people to try out the game and report 
anything that does not work correctly or seems to be unstable. The task 
of testing is growing with the size of FreedroidRPG. We need your help. 
This may look like something of low importance, but a game without 
quality assurance is likely to be more frustrating than entertaining.
</p>
<h2>Small or large projects</h2>
<p class="bodytext">We have many project ideas that can be tackled, for example by Google Summer of Code applicants. See <a href="http://www.freedroid.org/developer-area/contribute/#c57">below</a> for the project ideas.
</p>
<h2>Creating new maps</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The overall duration of FreedroidRPG is strongly 
tied to the amount and the size of levels that the player will go 
through. The current world is quite small, and we need more levels to 
extend the game. The random dungeon generator can help us, but only to a
 certain extent.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">The leveleditor is accessible from the main menu of 
the game. Its documentation is scarce, but the developers will happily 
assist anyone playing with the editor!
</p>
<h2>Sound effects</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The biggest flaw of FreedroidRPG as of this writing 
is its almost complete lack of decent sound effects, which breaks the 
immersion of the players. If you can create sound effects, or have time 
to browse existing free (as in free speech) sound databases, your help 
is required!
</p>
<h2>Various</h2>
<p class="bodytext">More music, more dialogs, more items, improvements 
on the gameplay rules (for example rethinking the player stats) are 
always welcome.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="http://www.freedroid.org/developer-area/contribute/">Go to top</a></p></div><div id="c56" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n3"><h1>How to contribute</h1></div><h2>General</h2>
<p class="bodytext">To contribute to FreedroidRPG, you will need to <a href="http://www.freedroid.org/download/#c47">get the game from the Subversion repository</a>. You should also <a href="http://www.freedroid.org/contact/">get in touch</a> with the team, in case you have questions or need comments on your idea.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Our advice, based on years of experience working 
with people making their first contribution to FreedroidRPG or to free 
software in general, is to start small. Take your idea, and cut it in 
the smallest pieces that make sense, then do the first piece and submit 
it. Starting small is the best way of becoming a successful free 
software contributor - because oversized projects tend to be motivation 
killers in the long run.
</p>
<h2>Our tools and workflow</h2>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p class="bodytext">IRC is our primary communication means in the team. 
Many of our contributors do not join the IRC channel and communicate by 
e-mail or using our ReviewBoard (see below). Google Summer of Code 
students and applicants are however required to maintain some presence 
on IRC.
</p>
<h3>ReviewBoard</h3>
<p class="bodytext">We have a <a href="https://rb.freedroid.org/" target="_blank">FreedroidRPG Reviewboard</a> (abbreviated <tt>RB</tt>)
 instance that is used for all incoming changes that affect the game's 
code (source code, but also maps and dialogs). This is where you will 
most likely submit the changes you make.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You need to create an account on Reviewboard before 
you can start submitting tickets or reviewing other people's code (this 
is strongly encouraged even if you aren't an active FreedroidRPG 
developer).
</p>
<h3>Trackers</h3>
<p class="bodytext">We rely on our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&amp;group_id=54521&amp;atid=474016" target="_blank">bug tracker</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&amp;group_id=54521&amp;atid=474019" target="_blank">feature request tracker</a>
 to list all the bugs that are found, and the requests from people who 
have a nice idea but are not able to implement it at the moment.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Please report the issues you encounter with the game!
</p>
<h3>Buildbot</h3>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="http://buildbot.freedroid.org/" target="_blank">http://buildbot.freedroid.org/</a>
 makes sure that we do not break the build, and automatically 
cross-compiles Microsoft Windows binaries for the less lucky of us who 
are stuck to this platform.
</p>
<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="http://wiki.freedroid.org/" target="_blank">http://wiki.freedroid.org/</a>
 is a wiki (not publically editable) that we use to store some ideas and
 documentation. Reading it is advised, but what is written there is not 
authoritative.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="http://www.freedroid.org/developer-area/contribute/">Go to top</a></p></div><div id="c57" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n4"><h1>Open jobs (project ideas)</h1></div><p class="bodytext">We
 have a list of open jobs for outsiders. It notably contains Google 
Summer of Code project ideas. Note that you can also pick from the 
trackers or make your own choice! In any case, <a href="http://www.freedroid.org/contact/">discussing your idea</a> with the team before formally submitting is a requirement.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Check our <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/freedroid" target="_blank">application requirements</a>.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In addition, we would like applicants to submit one 
or more patches to the game, in order to gauge coding ability and 
motivation. These patches can be related to your chosen project, an item
 from the bug tracker or feature request tracker, or an improvement in 
our current code. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG, despite being in an advanced stage 
(and moving closer to 1.0), gets a significant number of bug reports, 
and an incredible number of feature requests. There are quite a few 
hairy issues that require a good knowledge of the codebase, but most of 
the issues are accessible to a newcomer who has time on his hands. See 
our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?limit=100&amp;func=&amp;group_id=54521&amp;atid=474016&amp;status=&amp;status=1&amp;artifact_id=&amp;submit=Filter" target="_blank">bug tracker</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=54521&amp;atid=474019&amp;status=&amp;status=1&amp;submit=Filter" target="_blank">feature request tracker</a>.
 Fixing bugs and implementing requested features could make a decent 
project, and be appropriate for people with various skill levels. Many 
small flaws do not require experience writing software, only a basic 
understanding of C and Lua, and a strong willingness to learn.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Difficulty ranges anywhere from easy to hard, depending on what bugs are picked.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Scripting improvements</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG uses the Lua language to provide 
scripting support, in dialogs and as ingame events. You will have to 
increase FreedroidRPG scriptability to match the needs of the people 
writing dialogs.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">The project requires an interest in game design, an 
ability to read documentation, knowledge - or ability to learn quickly -
 of Lua, and, depending on the subtasks, a moderate to significant 
experience with C. Being a C expert or having extensive Lua experience 
is a plus but by no means required.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You will have to:</p><ul><li>support spawning of enemies from scripts</li>
<li>add the ability for the engine to specify large zones as event triggers instead of a 1x1 square only</li>
<li>add a "enter level" event hook</li>
<li>improve animated obstacles support</li>
<li>improve interaction of the player with the environment (breakable walls, etc.)</li>
<li>add support for player scripted actions/movement ("ingame" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene" target="_blank">cutscenes</a>) </li>
<li>review submitted patches to spot "patterns" in Lua script usage and provide improvements</li>
<li>improve the savegame mechanism to be able to save Lua global 
variables, making it possible to use such persistent variables in 
dialogs</li>
<li>bonus: add support for cinematics ("real video" cutscenes)</li>
</ul><p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Floor tiles improvement: multilayer and animation</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG uses floor tiles to represent the 
floor. There are several elements such as water and grass, that exist in
 many variants due to the existence of corners and borders. The single 
layer of floor tiles introduces a painful limitation because it is 
impossible to represent both "grass over road" and "grass over sand" 
without rendering those two in blender. We would like to have the 
ability to have (semi) transparent floor tiles, that can be layered on 
top of others.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Additionally, floor tiles are static, so it is not 
possible to animate water or grass. It would greatly improve immersion 
of the player to be able to animate those tiles.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This project is moderately easy. It requires 
familiarity with Blender (ability to create some basic models and render
 existing ones). Experience in C and animated computer graphics is 
appreciated. You will have to:</p><ul>
<li>add support for rendering multilayer floor</li>
<li>modify level file format to handle multiple layers of floor tiles</li>
<li>design and implement a user interface in the editor to be able to 
work on multiple layers of tiles instead of just one at the moment</li>
<li>add support for animated floor tiles</li>
<li>animate water and grass, with help from graphics contributors if required</li>
<li>meet performance and memory space constraints when designing and implementing the technical solution</li>
<li>optional: implement "beautify water" in the leveleditor similar to the existing "beautify grass" feature</li>
</ul><p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Leveleditor overhaul</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG features an integrated graphical level 
editor. It works quite well, but needs some more work to increase the 
productivity of people making levels, and attract more contributors. 
Editors from other games such as The Sims could be an inspiration.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This moderately easy project requires a bit of 
experience with C, as you will have to work on the existing leveleditor 
which is a large piece of software (integrated into the game). You do 
not need to know C very well, nor have strong SDL and OpenGL experience.
 You need to have the ability and the will to learn C and be able to 
interact with FreedroidRPG's graphics layer (SDL, OpenGL).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you have experience designing or implementing 
graphical user interfaces, or working with isometric 3D level editors, 
this is a plus. Don't hesitate to play with our level editor as it is 
right now, it will help you understand the tasks. Various ideas of 
things to do are :</p><ul><li>handle placement of random and special enemies on the map</li>
<li>handle placement and basic editing of event triggers</li>
<li>improve leveleditor minimap</li>
<li>implement new tests in the ingame level validator to enforce design rules</li>
<li>anything you feel is important for the interface (you can work based
 on your own impressions or other people's who report to us what they 
would like to see regularly)</li>
</ul><p class="bodytext">Do also look at open items on the Bug and 
especially the Feature Request tracker. Most relevant tickets are tagged
 with Editor: or lvled: but some might not be.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Performance improvements</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG performance is acceptable, but the game
 is not able to run on as many machines as we would like. This is mostly
 due to insufficient OpenGL performance, which can be improved with a 
few changes, for example by reducing the amount of texture changes, and 
the overhead of vertex emission. Your job is to increase the performance
 of the game, with a focus on the graphics rendering part. FreedroidRPG 
is slower than it could be, and this is impairing our players who have 
low end graphics hardware (most of integrated Intel cards). The problem 
got bigger with the apparition of "netbooks" which usually have such 
limited hardware.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This project requires fairly good knowledge of C and
 a bit of OpenGL experience, as you will be required to implement things
 that are not trivial, in an existing codebase that you must not break 
(unless you fix it afterwards). You will need to do a lot of profiling 
(on the CPU *and* on the GPU) to make sure what you implemented actually
 improves performance. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You will need to have a "slow" test machine 
available - and your project might be to make FreedroidRPG run on it. 
There are still plenty of &lt; 1GHz processors in use, and FreedroidRPG 
is intended to be playable by everyone!
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some ideas are:</p><ul><li>try to use Nvidia's profiling tools (available for MS Windows only), and see if they give useful results, act accordingly</li>
<li>investigate use of Intel's gputop</li>
<li>do anything that appears necessary to you to improve GL performance</li>
Bonus task (for fun)
<li>if you have time and interest, play with disable-able additional effects such as GLSL explosions/flames</li>
</ul><p class="bodytext"><!--
</p>
<h2>Obstacles specification format improvements</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG defines as "obstacles" the elements of the map that do not interact with the player, and possibly blocks his way. Basically, "obstacles" designates walls, tables, chairs, shelves,... anything but items (which can be picked up) and robots/humans.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Our obstacles have collision rectangles, that describe the area they occupy on the map - the area the player/enemies cannot go into. Those rectangles are currently specified in a very limited way : they are hardcoded into the blocks.c source file. This makes them difficult to change, and forces a recompilation every time. Your job will be to clean this up and make obstacles easier to modify and add, by moving the specification to an external data file, and possibly writing it in Lua so we have several ways of describing the collision rectangle (X1 Y1 X2 Y2, X Y W H, offset relative to the center of the rectangle).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">If you have extra time, modify the engine so people can easily change those rectangles when adding a new obstacle (without reloading the game etc.)-->
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Improve assets (binary data) handling</h2>
<p class="bodytext">FreedroidRPG uses a custom format to store 
animations of robots and players. This format is poorly documented, not 
very efficient, and technically unjustified. It would be good to replace
 it with something that is future-proof and easy to work with, in order 
to help FreedroidRPG's graphics army be more efficient.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This project requires a good understanding of C, 
basic knowledge of Blender or similar tools. Previous experience working
 on open source software is appreciated for this project. The difficulty
 is moderate to high, because some of the code to be modified is at the 
core of the engine and therefore must not be broken. Tasks may include:</p><ul><li>replace
 existing uses of "tux_image_archive" (the aforementioned custom format)
 by a PNG texture atlas similar to what is already used for fonts or 
floor tiles</li>
<li>browse the feature request tracker and interview the graphics 
contributors to understand their needs and suggest ways of catering to 
them</li>
<li>provide a way for the game to reload part of its graphics without 
having to be restarted, as an attempt to speed up the testing process 
for graphics contributors</li>
<li>understand, unify, document, and integrate the existing FreedroidRPG texture atlas tools</li>
<li>provide reference Blender python scripts for rendering</li>
<li>modify the obstacle, enemy, items, floor, or tux graphics loading 
code to make the graphics creation process easier, perhaps based on 
actual small contributions you could try to make in order to get a 
feeling of what should be done</li></ul><p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>More minigames for takeover game</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The takeover feature of FreedroidRPG, which enables 
the player to turn enemy bots to his side, relies on a minigame that was
 in the original Paradroid on C64. This minigame is fairly interesting, 
but introducing more variety would be appreciated from many players.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This project is easy if you have experience writing 
minigames, or slightly challenging if you've never written games in the 
past and want to learn. You need to be extremely creative to be able to 
imagine several games, but if you have got no previous C or game writing
 experience this project is suitable for you.</p><ul><li>understand the original takeover game</li>
<li>write 2+ minigames that can be finished in less than one to two 
minutes of playing (those games must have a "difficulty" parameter 
similar to the "number of connectors of enemy" variable in the original 
takeover game)</li>
<li>provide graphics and sound effects for your games if possible</li>
<li>test the difficulty levels and do the balancing</li>
<li>(optional) improve the artificial intelligence of the original takeover game</li></ul><p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Multi-resolution support for the user interface</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The user interface of FreedroidRPG was designed at a
 single resolution (640x480). Practically everyone plays at a higher 
resolution than this. To accomodate for higher resolution, the game 
simply scales (zooms) the HUD parts. This is suboptimal for two reasons :</p><ul><li>non 4:3 resolutions will end up distorting the HUD, which looks ugly</li><li>high resolutions will enlarge the HUD disproportionately, yielding an ugly interface again.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">In
 order to improve the general look &amp; feel of the game, especially at
 high resolution on those "wide" screens, the user interface code has to
 be improved. Instead of zooming the user interface elements, the game 
should use (properly splitted) parts of those elements, only zooming the
 borders, so as not to enlarge decorations and to maximize the useful 
screen space.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This project requires an interest in human-computer 
interaction, and a minimal experience of user interface design. 
Experience with multi-resolution interface design for e.g. websites is a
 plus. Some knowledge of C will be required, as well as knowledge of one
 image editing tool such as Gimp.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You will have to:</p><ul><li>design a resolution-independent system for the FreedroidRPG user interface</li>
<li>split up the various user interface elements (HUD, dialog 
background, shop interface, ...) in individual elements to be either 
scaled or displayed without scaling</li>
<li>implement the system that makes use of the splitting user interface elements to create a true resolution-independant system</li>
<li>make the HUD use this system</li>
<li>move all other user interface elements of the game so that they use the new system</li></ul><p class="bodytext">The leveleditor is already resolution independent, but the rest of the game isn't.
