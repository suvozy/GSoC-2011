<h2> Welcome To Google Summer of Code and Atomic Blue!</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.atomicblue.org/">Atomic Blue</a> is a Non

Profit Corporation with the mission to foster the growth of a community

of developers skilled in developing multiplayer online role playing

games. Our activity is divided in two areas: <br>

</p>

<ul>

<li> building the <b>PlaneShift Engine</b>: an Open Source

(under GPL) engine for Massive Multiplayer Online Worlds, and one of

the few to be really usable and in production with thousands of users. </li>

<li> applying the engine to our major project the <a href="http://www.planeshift.it/">PlaneShift game</a>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Our team is a distributed team of talented and motivated

people, which share the same objective of building a great mmo engine

and to see it in action.

<h2>How to proceed in your GSoC experience!</h2>

Hi, since the beginning of the program we have moved our main page for 
GSOC to a wiki, where we can more easily edit and expand the ideas.<br>
<br>
Here are the next steps!: <br>
1) Read our mission in the <a href="http://www.atomicblue.org/">Atomic Blue</a> web site<br>
2) Read our <a href="http://www.planeshift.it/">PlaneShift web site</a> and learn more about the game we are building<br>
3) Review the ideas list below to get a feeling of what we want to implement<br>
4) Connect to our <a href="http://planeshift.ezpcusa.com/pswiki/index.php?title=GSoC_2011">GSoC wiki page</a> for latest news and your next steps!<br>
<br>

<h2>Ideas for Google SoC 2011!</h2>

<p>This page holds ideas collected for Google SoC. They are

divided in two sections, the one for which we have already a detailed

description and some initial design, and the ones for which we just

have a description. As soon as ideas get selected, we will document

more also the second group.<br>

<br>

For each idea you can find in parenthesis the complexity (easy, medium,

hard) and the mentor name.<br>

<br>

The program started, and we began to move this content to our Wiki

site, to allow collaborative editing and addition of your ideas to the

design documents.

</p>

<h2>Ideas with documentation</h2>

<h4>Economy</h4>

<ul>

<li> Implementation of an <a href="http://planeshift.ezpcusa.com/pswiki/index.php?title=Dynamic_Economy">Economy Manager</a>

(medium)

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Tribes</h4>

<ul>

<li> Artificial intelligence for <a href="http://planeshift.ezpcusa.com/pswiki/index.php?title=Tribes_expansion">Tribes</a>

(composed of various tasks from medium to high)

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Statistics</h4>

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://planeshift.ezpcusa.com/pswiki/index.php?title=Analysis_package">Analysis package</a> of data mining

data (Medium)  and better server reporting. </li>


</ul>

<h4>Sound</h4>

<ul>

<li> <b><a href="http://planeshift.ezpcusa.com/pswiki/index.php?title=Sound_System">Sound System</a></b>: improve the sound manager, make it more flexible and allow association of sounds to in game events, scripts, monsters actions.</li>

</ul>

<h4>GUI</h4>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://planeshift.ezpcusa.com/pswiki/index.php?title=Improved_UI">GUI</a>
 improvements. Includes improvements to the Help system, fixes to the 
interface, conversion to plugin. Enhancement to the Container System, 
and Crafting of books.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Ideas without documentation</h2>

<p>

</p>


<h4>Database</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>Database reconstruction</b>: Optimise database with

innodb triggers, rework of tables, new index, scalability and subdivision of data between different servers...(hard)<br>

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Networking</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>IPV4 TO IPV6</b>: changing the code so it doesn't rely 
specifically on IPV4 or IPV6, allow to define various listen interfaces 
either IPV4 and IPV6. Remove network logic which can be left to system 
libraries. Conversion to plugin.(easy to medium depending on the parts 
which are picked up)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Effect Library</h4><ul>

<li><b>PSEFFECT</b>: conversion to plugin and performance optimizations. Maybe adding support for 2d objects.(medium)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Server reliability</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>Unit Testing</b>: Implement a basic unit testing

framework for common server commands and actions. (Medium)

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Entities Behaviour</h4>

<ul>

<li> Script additional NPC brains/types/behaviours. (Easy) </li>

<li> Improve pathfinding and combat AI. (Medium)

</li>

</ul>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul><li><b>Hardcoding removal</b>: Due to the fact the PlaneShift engine
 has been in development for years, unfortunately, it brings with itself
 some design faults which at the time allowed to speed up development 
but now are an hindrance and will require editing of the project source 
for deployment. The scope of removing hardcoding is moving all the 
resources previously in code (like skills, money specifications, 
interfaces, database tables design) in order to be data driven (at 
maximum script driven) and not anymore hard wired in the internals of 
the engine. This is actually a lot of sub works some bigger and more 
difficult and some more easy and fast to accomplish.(easy to hard)</li></ul>
